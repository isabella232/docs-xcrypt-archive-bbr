This documentation describes Zettaset XCrypt Archive for VMware Tanzu. 

BOSH Backup and Restore provides a framework for the backup and restore of your BOSH deployments in VMware Tanzu environments.
Those backups contain your critical data and must be protected. 
Zettaset XCrypt Archive for VMware Tanzu provides a powerful solution for protecting your VMware Tanzu backups. 

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

XCrypt Archive for VMware Tanzu is a high-performance, software-only backup and restore solution that works with structured and unstructured data.
It interoperates with KMIP-compliant key managers, including Zettaset's Virtual Enterprise Key Manager.
If you already have a key manager, you can continue to use it.
If not, you can use Zettaset's software-only solution. 

XCrypt Archive for VMware Tanzu utilizes Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit encryption, the highest level attainable.
AES has been adopted by the U.S. government and is now used worldwide.
It also provides AES-NI accelerated performance in equipped servers.

Zettaset's software-only approach to encryption simplifies deployment and eliminates the need for proprietary appliances.
Its configurable key policies and key administration provide the flexibility necessary for your enterprise.
It is designed to be deployed on existing commodity hardware,
drastically reducing the total cost of ownership compared to proprietary appliance-based solutions.
Zettaset's products can be deployed and maintained by existing IT staff and do not require specialized encryption experts.
